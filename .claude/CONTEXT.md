## Current state

**ALL PHASES COMPLETE (0 through 6) — the build plan is finished.** Phase 6 (`tests/e2e/order-flow.test.ts`, new `@quickbite/e2e` workspace package) wires order, kitchen, and notification together in one test: one Postgres container hosting all 3 databases (`order_db`/`kitchen_db`/`notification_db`, created via raw `CREATE DATABASE` statements — mirroring `docker/init.sql`'s shape), one shared RabbitMQ + Redis container, each service's real entrypoint dynamically imported in sequence (same env-var + dynamic-import technique as Phase 5). A real `POST /orders` via `server.inject()` drives the whole chain; the test polls both kitchen's and notification's own databases until the full happy path completes.

**The one real architectural problem this phase surfaced, and the actual fix**: running `bun test` from the repo root executes every `*.test.ts` file in ALL packages within a SINGLE OS process by default. Since every service's `db.ts` reads `DATABASE_URL` from `process.env` once at module-load time, and Bun caches dynamically-imported modules by absolute path, a later test file calling `await import("../../services/order/src/server.ts")` could receive an already-cached module instance still pointing at an EARLIER test file's (already-stopped) Testcontainers Postgres. Tried Bun's `--isolate` flag (gives each file a fresh module/global context) — it didn't fully fix this, because `process.env` is OS-process-wide regardless of `--isolate`, and it also silently stopped honoring `bunfig.toml`'s test timeout, causing new failures. The actual fix: every package that has tests now has its own `"test": "bun test"` script, and the root script became `bun run --filter '*' --sequential test` — Bun's workspace filter spawns each package's tests as a genuinely separate OS process, which is real isolation, not just module-context isolation. Root `package.json`, every relevant `package.json`, and `.github/workflows/ci.yml`'s test step were updated to match.

**Also worth knowing for next time**: a `docker upgrade`-adjacent slip — an exploratory `strings $(which bun)`-adjacent command accidentally triggered `bun upgrade --canary`, bumping the global Bun install from `1.3.10` to a `1.4.0-canary` prerelease. Caught immediately and reverted via `bun upgrade --stable` (landed on `1.3.14`, the current stable patch — not byte-identical to `1.3.10`, but the same stable channel). And earlier in Phase 5: a Docker cleanup command filtered by `ancestor=postgres:16` accidentally matched and removed the real, long-running `quickbite-postgres-1` container — no data lost (named volume `pgdata` persisted) but worth remembering: never filter Docker cleanup by image name when other real containers share that image.

Snyk: 0 issues across every changed package, including `tests/e2e`. Typecheck green (now also covers `tests/e2e`). `bun run test` from the repo root: every package's suite passes (order 4, kitchen 2, notification 2, menu 2, shared 2, e2e 1 — 13 total), confirmed stable across 4 repeated full runs, exit code 0 every time, no orphaned Testcontainers left running (Ryuk reaper confirmed clean each time).

**Workflow reminder**: every phase gets its own branch off `main`, pushed with a PR via `gh pr create` — never commit straight to `main`. No Claude/Anthropic references in commits, PRs, or files (user's explicit preference). Repo: https://github.com/devinder-dev/quickbite (public).

## Fix-up pass: exam-criteria gaps (branch `fix-exam-criteria`)

After all 6 phases were done, a pass comparing the system against the actual examination brief (single public entry point, README accuracy, pure unit tests for logic) surfaced and fixed:

1. **Single public entry point lockdown** — `docker-compose.yml` no longer publishes host ports for `postgres`, `redis`, `rabbitmq`, or `gateway`; nginx is now `80:80` (was `8080:80`). A new `docker-compose.dev.yml` (NOT auto-merged — must be passed explicitly via `-f`) restores host ports for `postgres`/`redis`/`rabbitmq` for local debugging only. Verified empirically: `docker compose ps` shows only nginx with a port mapping, internal ports closed to the host, full order flow works through nginx alone, dev override restores infra ports without exposing the gateway.
2. **README rewritten** to match the actual built system and state the single entry point (`http://localhost`, port 80, via nginx) explicitly.
3. **Two pure unit tests added**, satisfying the brief's explicit (separate from integration/e2e) unit-testing requirement: `services/order/src/pricing.ts` (`computeTotalCents`, extracted out of `server.ts`'s route handler) and `packages/shared/src/mq.ts`'s `backoffMs` (now exported). Cache-aside and Redis-NX idempotency logic deliberately left to existing integration tests, not forced into mocks.
4. **Real bug found and fixed — gateway proxy was completely broken.** `@fastify/http-proxy` (via `@fastify/reply-from`) forwards through a Node-style undici `Pool` whose `.request()` Bun's runtime doesn't implement compatibly — every proxied call threw `pool.request is not a function`. This had never been caught because nothing had tested the real flow through nginx until this pass. Fixed by hand-rolling the proxy in `services/gateway/src/index.ts` with Bun's native `fetch()`; removed `@fastify/http-proxy` from `services/gateway/package.json`. Verified end-to-end through the real Docker stack (menu read, place order, order status, 404, full kitchen/notification event chain).
5. **Second real bug found and fixed — `RedisIdempotency` read `REDIS_URL` into a module-level constant at import time**, not inside the constructor. Any test file that statically imports `@quickbite/shared` (which re-exports `idempotency.ts`) before setting `process.env.REDIS_URL` in `beforeAll` locks in the fallback `redis://localhost:6379` — a port nothing is listening on — causing every Redis call in that test run to fail with `ioredis Unhandled error event`. This looked exactly like Docker Desktop network flakiness (same symptom, same unchanged-test-also-fails evidence) but survived a full Docker Desktop restart, which is what proved it was a code bug, not an environment issue. Fixed by moving the `process.env.REDIS_URL` read into `RedisIdempotency`'s constructor default parameter. **Lesson: any module-level `const X = process.env.Y ?? fallback` in a file reachable via a package barrel (`packages/shared/src/index.ts`) is unsafe for tests that set env vars in `beforeAll` — only safe if the env read happens inside a function/constructor, not at import time.**

Snyk: 0 issues. Typecheck and full `bun run test` (all 6 packages) green after both bug fixes.

## Addition: React frontend (branch `feature/frontend`, additive, not graded)

After backend submission, the user wanted a UI to click-test the system themselves before the oral defense. New top-level `frontend/` (React + Vite + TypeScript, react-router-dom), its own 7th Docker container with a healthcheck, served by a hand-rolled Bun static file server (`frontend/serve.ts` — path-traversal-safe, SPA-fallback for client routes). `nginx.conf` now splits traffic: `/api/*` and `= /health` → gateway (unchanged), everything else → the new `frontend` upstream — nginx remains the system's only published port.

Key decisions, each one a deliberate fix for a concrete risk surfaced during planning/implementation, not guesswork:
- **Did NOT import `OrderItem` from `@quickbite/shared`** for client-side cart validation — that package's barrel re-exports `mq.ts`/`idempotency.ts`, which pull in `amqplib`/`ioredis` (Node-only, not browser-safe). Duplicated a minimal zod schema in `frontend/src/lib/orderItem.ts` instead, same "client previews, server stays authoritative" reasoning as `cartTotal.ts` vs. `services/order/src/pricing.ts`.
- **`useOrderPolling` hook**: setTimeout-chain (never raw `setInterval`, to avoid overlapping in-flight requests), AbortController + `cancelled` flag (no setState-after-unmount), treats a 404 as "not found yet" within a bounded ~60s window (not fatal — the outbox pattern means the row can briefly lag right after `POST /orders` returns), explicit "timed-out" UI state if `"ready"` is never reached.
- **Real test-infra bug found and fixed**: `@testing-library/react`'s `screen` binds to `document.body` once, at *module-load time* — and ESM hoists all `import` statements above any other code regardless of where they're written. A static `import { cleanup } from "@testing-library/react"` at the top of `frontend/tests/setup.ts`, written after `GlobalRegistrator.register()` in source order, was still being evaluated *before* it at runtime, permanently breaking every `screen.*` query. Fixed with a dynamic `await import("@testing-library/react")` placed after registration. Also needed an `afterEach(cleanup)` — without it, happy-dom's shared document persists rendered output across test files, causing false "multiple elements found" errors.
- Frontend's own `zod` was pinned to `^3.23.8` to match the rest of the repo (it resolved to v4 by default) — same major version everywhere, deliberately.
- Verified live, not just via tests: full `docker compose up --build` → `frontend` reaches `healthy` → curl-driven `placed → accepted → ready` through nginx → confirmed a hard-refresh on a deep link like `/orders/<uuid>` returns the SPA shell (200), not a 404 → confirmed path-traversal attempts on `serve.ts` fall through safely to the SPA fallback, never leak a file outside `dist/` → confirmed the public-entry-point invariant still holds (only nginx has a published port; frontend's internal port 3005 is unreachable from the host).

Snyk: 0 issues. Typecheck and full `bun run test` (now 7 packages, frontend included — pure `lib/` unit tests + `happy-dom`-backed component tests) green.

**Per explicit user instruction: do not merge this branch automatically.** Wait for the user's own manual click-through in a real browser before merging — unlike every prior phase, where merge was pre-approved.

## Next step

Frontend branch is implemented, tested, and verified server-side — pending the user's own manual browser click-through, then commit/push/PR/merge. After that: no more build work planned. The user's next intent is a Q&A/walkthrough session to fully understand the codebase ahead of the oral defense (explain architecture, justify decisions, describe traffic flow, name an error scenario and its handling). Possible further follow-ups if wanted later: a real notification send (email/push, still a `TODO` in `services/notification/src/index.ts`), CI badge/status in `README.md`, or load-testing the outbox poller under concurrent order volume.

## Key files to know

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `packages/shared/src/events.ts` | Single source of truth for all event Zod schemas |
| `packages/shared/src/mq.ts` | RabbitMQ connect/publish/consume helpers |
| `docker-compose.yml` | All infra — Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis, Nginx, services |
| `.env.example` | Template for all env vars — copy to `.env` |

## Environment

Each service reads the same env var name, `DATABASE_URL` — docker-compose.yml sets a different value per container:

```bash
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672
DATABASE_URL=postgres://quickbite:quickbite@localhost:5432/<service>_db   # order_db | menu_db | kitchen_db | notification_db
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```
